        <strong>In life, I will have to make a lot of choices</strong>. I won’t be able to pursue everything I want to - it’s impossible
        to have the time to do so. Because of this, it’s important to make deliberate choices while considering the
        various effects of my choices down the road.
        <li>
            “The idea of making one’s own decisions in life can be seen in the poem “The Road Not Taken”. In the poem,
            the narrator has to choose between two different paths in a forest. This is evident when the narrator says,
            “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I / I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the
            difference” (Frost lines 18-20). This quote clearly shows how the narrator of the poem has to choose between two paths,
            which represent an important choice that will have a major impact on the outcome of their life. This can
            be seen when the narrator says that choosing the less popular path made “all the difference”. The theme
            of making your own decisions can also be seen when the narrator of the poem tries to see the potential
            outcomes of the paths that are open to them.”

        <strong>Regardless of what programming field I go into, hacking will be something that I’ll have to guard against in all of
        them</strong>. With the assistance of AI, hacking could be a much bigger problem than it is currently, especially if the number
        and scale of attacks increase greatly as a result.
        <li>
            “An academic research paper on the implications of AI in hacking states, “In addition, malicious hackers may
            implement the ability to adapt to a new environment or use the intelligence learned from past AI incidents
            to build intelligent viruses and malware or model adaptable attacks. As a result, malware becomes autonomous,
            blends into its environment, takes countermeasures against security tools, and can use previously acquired
            data to target the device” (Vishnu 57). AI-powered cyberattacks also have the potential to be much stronger
            than those executed by humans, as noticed by the HackerLLM blog: “One concern is the potential for AI to
            automate the entire hacking process from reconnaissance to exploitation and post-exploitation activities.
            This level of automation could lead to a significant increase in the number and scale of cyber attacks. Furthermore
            AI-powered attacks can adapt and evolve in real-time making them more difficult to detect and mitigate”
            (“The Evolution of AI Hacking from Script Kiddies to Sophisticated Machine Learning Algorithms”).”

        <strong>Psychology is something I’m interested in - specifically, why people make certain choices when the reasoning behind
        them could be incredibly confusing or unclear to other people</strong>. The below passage also connects to the theme because
        H is passionate about his work, even if he’s forced into it.
        <li>
            “The psychological lens can also provide insight into why characters deal with certain situations the way they
            do. It sheds light on H’s choice to stay at the mines after he is freed from Rock Slope. After H meets Dinah
            in Pete’s Bar and he is revealed as an ex-convict, he “knew that he couldn’t go back to the free world, marked
            as he was” (Gyasi 167). At first glance, someone might have no idea why H would choose to continue to do the
            work that almost killed him multiple times, and that killed other people. However, it’s easier for someone
            to understand if they know that he used to be a convict, as well as being a black person, which was heavily
            stigmatized at that period in time. If someone recognizes his situation, they would likely recognize that
            returning to the mines might be H’s only option for work, given his past and skin color. Furthermore, he was
            highly skilled and strong, and was able to consistently work at a high efficiency, shown when he filled his
            and Thomas’ quotas holding a shovel in each hand. All in all, the psychological critical analysis lens can
            provide valuable insight to how characters react to certain situations.”

    <h2>Revised Daily Write</h2>
    <h3>Before</h3>
    <p>
        An author of books about punctuation, Keith Houston in his BBC article, The Mysterious Origins of Punctuation,
        published in 2nd September 2015 by BBC addresses the topic of the history of punctuation and argues that we need
        punctuation more now than ever before. He supports this claim by giving reasons why speaking used to be more
        important than reading, then giving the reasons why punctuation began to appear, then how punctuation evolved to
        become more and more useful, and finally noting that though punctuation had occasionally been removed in some places,
        it always came back. Houston’s purpose is to educate readers on how punctuation became commonplace all around the
        world. He adopts an academic and informative tone for his audience, the readers of BBC, and others interested in
        the topic of the origins of punctuation.

    <p>
        An author of books about punctuation, Keith Houston, in his BBC article, The Mysterious Origins of Punctuation,
        published on 2nd September 2015 by the BBC, addresses the topic of the history of punctuation and argues that we
        need punctuation more now than ever before. He supports this claim by giving reasons why speaking used to be more
        important than reading, then giving the reasons why punctuation began to appear, then how punctuation evolved to
        become more and more useful, and finally noting that though punctuation had occasionally been removed in some
        places, it always came back. He also noted that as societies became more powerful and advanced, punctuation was
        more complicated as a result, implying that punctuation is needed to convey complex ideas more accurately. Noted
        also is the fact that for a long time, punctuation has remained stagnant and without change, though society continues
        to develop. He argues that this means punctuation is likely to undergo change sometime soon. Also conveyed is the
        idea that punctuation will change again soon because other forms of written text are developing, such as typing
        and emojis, and punctuation needs to catch up. Houston’s purpose in writing the article is to educate readers on
        how punctuation became commonplace all around the world. He adopts an academic and informative tone for his audience,
        namely the readers of the BBC, and others interested in the topic of the origins of punctuation. This could also
        include people interested in punctuation or the writing system as a whole.
