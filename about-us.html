    <h2>[Game dev studio name]</h2>

    <p id="studio-desc">
        We are a small group of young developers seven members strong. We are a completely new
        mobile dev studio, with very little experience in the field. We currently have zero games released, although we are
        working on one right now.
    </p>

                <p>
                    Ayansh (he/him) enjoys swimming, coding, playing Warframe, and doing other things related to the dev studio. He
                    joined the studio automaticaly, as he founded it. His favourite colours are blue and black, and he believes in
                    hard work if you want to complete your goals.

                <h4>Max // ZeBoss</h4>
                <p>
                    Max (he/him) enjoys reading, playing video games, mountain biking, and D&D. He joined the dev studio because he
                    likes coding, and wants to learn how to make complex games in other languages. His favourite colour is
                    royal purple, and finally, he believes MacOS is better than WindowsOS, so his opinions aren't valid.
