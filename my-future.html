        Depending on how things pan out, I could go into various programming fields. I could go into a robotics field
        and focus primarily on programming robots such as Boston Dynamics’ Atlas or Tesla’s Optimus. Alternatively, I
        could go into web development and design websites for major companies. Maybe I end up going into cybersecurity,
        ensuring there are no vulnerabilities in a piece of software and patching them if there are. Another possibility
        is working as a sysadmin, a person who works with a team to manage a company’s computer systems and networks to
        keep everything running smoothly.

        A potential problem could be an increase in AI programming capabilities. However, this isn’t an issue, at least
        for the immediately foreseeable future, as AI is incapable of writing complex code to solve a problem or perform a
        role. Its performance becomes even worse when it doesn’t have context about the code it needs to integrate with not
        to break more things than it could potentially fix. Fortunately, if AI does become a more capable programmer than
        human beings, I will still likely be able to secure a job in a programming-related field, or possibly work as an “AI-manager”
        to make sure it’s doing everything right.
