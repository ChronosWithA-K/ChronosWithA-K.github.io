                Depending on how things pan out, I could go into various programming fields. I could go into a robotics field
                and focus primarily on programming robots such as Boston Dynamics’ 'Atlas' or Tesla’s 'Optimus'. Alternatively, I
                could go into web development and design websites for major companies. Maybe I end up going into cybersecurity,
                ensuring there are no vulnerabilities in a piece of software and patching them if there are. Depending on AI's
                capabilities in a few years, the scale and number of cyberattacks could increase greatly. Another possibility
                is working as a sysadmin, a person who works with a team to manage a company’s computer systems and networks to
                keep everything running smoothly. Another potential job avenue would be an AI engineer.

                A potential problem could be an increase in AI programming capabilities. However, this isn’t an issue, at least
                for the immediately foreseeable future, as AI is incapable of writing complex code to solve a problem or perform a
                role. Its performance becomes even worse when it doesn’t have context about the code it needs to integrate with not
                to break more things than it could potentially fix. Fortunately, if AI does become a more capable programmer than
                human beings, I will still likely be able to secure a job in a programming-related field, or possibly work as an “AI-manager”
                to make sure it’s doing everything right.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p class="conclusion">
        Looking back on my portfolio, I see a lot of growth. I have learned a lot of skills, and I have developed a lot of interests.
        I have become much more skilled in programming than I was just last year, which is proof I'm continuing to grow,
        and will be for likely my entire life. I have also spread out into various programming fields, learning lots as
        I go along. Some of these fields include web development and robotics, and I look forward to taking these skills to
        new heights in the years to come, in addition to learning even more skills. I'm especially interested in developing
        knowledge about cybersecurity and AI. While I know that these fields are competitive, I have confidence in being
        able to secure a place for myself.
