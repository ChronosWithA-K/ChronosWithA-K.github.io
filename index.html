    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p class="memoir">
        &emsp;&emsp;Throughout my so-far short life, I have engaged in many forms of learning and opportunities. I have travelled
        around the world and discovered things I’m good at and enjoy, and things I want to do in the future.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;I was born in 2009 in the oppressive heat of San Diego. Three years later, my sister would be born. I am primarily
        of British and Korean heritage, I went to a private school where I remained until the first grade. I made some
        friends, discovered a passion for reading and, to a lesser extent, writing, and developed these skills throughout
        my school years. In true child-like fashion, I also enjoyed drawing and sketching, and while I haven’t developed
        these skills to anywhere near a professional level, I still use them occasionally in my spare time.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;For the second
        grade, I moved to Tiburon and enrolled at Reed School. I would remain in the Reed district for the rest of elementary
        and middle school, going to first Bel Aire and then Del Mar. I made some friends and lost some friends, adapted
        to new experiences, and made new memories. At Del Mar, I became interested in programming and engineering, and I
        still pursue these activities today. I took programming and Computer Aided Design, or CAD, classes, slowly developing
        my skills. I mostly focused on the Python programming language during this time, but also dabbled slightly in Java.
        For most of my life, I wasn’t, all things considered, particularly good at math. However, in seventh and eighth grade
        at Del Mar, this turned around, and I became much more skilled. The content became much easier to digest and
        understand, and fortunately still is. It was also around this time that I became invested in video games, which
        would become one of my greatest hobbies and likely always will be. In my last year at the school, I joined the school’s
        robotics team, and we would go on to compete in the FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC, taking second place in the regional
        competition. As my programming skills weren’t sufficiently advanced enough to program the robot at the moment, I
        stayed mostly on the engineering side of things, but I would still advance my programming knowledge during this
        time with one of my team’s mentors, Mr. SF, who’s a teacher here at Redwood. I would help out with programming,
        but I couldn’t do much. During my time at Del Mar, I became known as the “quiet kid.” I’ve never been very social,
        and a large part of that started there, at Del Mar.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;When I graduated and started going to Redwood, I continued
        learning more about programming and robotics. I signed up for the programming elective, where I learned more about
        Python. I also started web development, and would develop and launch two separate websites during this time. I
        coded this website too, forgoing the use of a third-party site builder to grow my skills more. I would join Redwood’s
        robotic team with some of my friends from the previous one, and this time I would focus much more on programming,
        now that my skills had increased. Unfortunately, we did much worse during this time. We didn’t have as much time
        as before to work on the robot, so while it worked, it wasn’t as capable as some of the other robots. However, we
        weren’t as limited by materials as some of the other teams, which helped us immensely as we iterated on our robot’s
        design to improve its capabilities in the field. In my sophomore year, I joined the team again, except with a vast
        improvement on my prior programming skills, I was able to sign on as lead programmer. I built the majority of the
        robot’s code from the ground up, focusing on making it as simple and easy to use as possible, so our team’s driver
        could focus more on the game and less on the controls. In my freshman year, I would propose and launch a club with
        a friend of mine. Our club focused on app and website development, and has been successful so far. To date, we have
        published two apps to the Apple App Store and created a website for our club. In addition, I signed up for the AP
        CSA and Intro to Engineering classes, further focusing in on those fields. I would also learn about a well-known Q&A
        network known as Stack Exchange, or SE, that aims to become an accurate knowledge repository on topics ranging from
        programming to video games to everything in between. Over time, I would slowly become a well-known user on some of
        the sites, especially on Arqade, the site for video games. I would also find people who share similar interests to
        mine and talk with them regularly. I became very interested in anime and Asian music as well, primarily Japanese
        and Korean. I especially enjoy the music of Hatsune Miku, a popular virtual pop-idol and voicebank synthesis software
        known as a Vocaloid. I would rarely, if ever, listen to English music after this. Although I don’t understand languages
        besides English and a bit of Spanish, I’m interested in learning Japanese and Korean, and maybe Chinese too.
        However, I haven’t been able to make much progress due to a lack of time and not being able to talk with native
        speakers. I also don’t want to pay for a subscription for a language learning service, which most require. I became
        interested in a popular imaginative tabletop role-playing game known as Dungeons and Dragons, or DnD, as well. I
        primarily act as the Dungeon Master, or DM, someone who creates the world and sets the rules rather than live in
        it, which is what the players do. I’m not all that experienced, unfortunately. I continued playing tennis through
        this time, a sport I’ve been playing for a couple of years. Another sport I’m interested in is parkour, but I don’t
        really have the time or ability to get started at the moment.
