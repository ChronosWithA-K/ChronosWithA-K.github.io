    <h4>Upriver Fish Game - Devlog 1</h4>
    <p class="devlog">
        For our game idea, we wanted to make something to do with fishing. We eventually landed on a simple game where the player,
        some kind of fish (probably a salmon) has to go upriver to reach the spawn pools. There'll be an infinite scrolling river, with obstacles
        that a salmon might face on their journey, such as bears or fishers. There won't really be an end to the game, we were thinking
        it would be an infinite top-down scroller. We chose the Solar2D engine for the game, since it seemed good, as you could publish
        to both Apple and Android app stores, and there was documentation on it. We've all had some experience in Lua, which isn't a very
        complicated language, so it seemed like we could make a game in it. We didn't start developing yet.
    </p>
    <p><em>Here</em> are some <strong>common</strong> ideas that we had in our separate game ideas (besides the one we eventually chose):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fisher is on a boat, can change fishing spots</li>
        <li>Better/rarer fish farther down</li>
        <li>Drop a hook and control it on its way down</li>
        <li>Can sell fish to a restaurant, or maybe an aquarium</li>
        <li>Maybe some kind of boss fights or encounters</li>
        <li>Can hire people in towns to help with fishing</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Upriver Fish Game - Devlog 2</h4>
    <p class="devlog">
        We started developing. We got the Live Share extension in VS Code, so we could write code and see what everyone else was doing in
        real time. We set up the repo, and got a bit familiar with the Solar2D engine and what it offered. We added an asset loader, to
        make changing file locations easier, and we added an options button for changing the settings. Most of this developing period
        was spent familiarizing ourselves with the way the engine was set up, how it worked, etc. We added a test sound to the game too,
        to see how audio worked, which went well. We used the built-in example play button to load some random assets in and see how that
        worked.
    </p>

    <h4>Upriver Fish Game - Devlog 3</h4>
    <p class="devlog">
        We added master volume, game sounds volume, and music volume sliders to the options button. We tried to add some movement
        to the fish and make the background scroll, at which point we discovered that the Live Share extension was glitching for one our members,
        and we couldn't see anything they wrote. Another annoying thing is that only the person that was hosting the live share (because it had
        to be hosted for the Live Share extension to work) could commit changes to GitHub or run the most recent changes on the virtual phone
        provided by Solar2D; in other words, someone either always had to be running the virtual phone and listening to requests of what to
        do if we wanted to check our code, or always be committing code constantly, even if the code was one line long. It was extremely
        annoying, and meant that one person couldn't do much because they always had to be testing things, instead of coding. We fixed some 
        errors where the play button would give an error if clicked. We didn't really like how the Lua language and Solar2D engine were
        working, so we considered switching engines (and languages). We haven't decided on anything yet, but we're currently deciding 
        between Godot, Unity, and .NET MAUI.
    </p>

    <h4>Upriver Fish Game - Devlog 3.5</h4>
    <p class="devlog">
        Note that this wasn't a development stage, just a point where we made some important decisions about the game going forwards. We changed the
        language we were working in, chose a framework, and a couple more things.
    </p>
    <p class="devlog">
        We decided to try out the libGDX framework. We thought it would work pretty well, and Java would be more useful to know and have experience in
        than, say, Lua. We set up the project relatively easily, though we ran into some issues with libGDX not being able to find the Android SDK ( We
        downloaded the wrong tools). Though we had to download Android Studios to get the project set up, we wanted to use IntelliJ IDEA as our IDE. We
        also all had access to their premium version, so it would be good to get value out of that while we can. Unfortunately, most of us didn't have
        access to Xcode, which was the only way to put a game on the iOS app store using the libGDX framework (we were using WindowsOS for the most part,
        and Xcode is for MacOS). Because of this, we chose to optimize our game for Android, and if we wanted to later, our MacOS dev would port it to
        iOS.
